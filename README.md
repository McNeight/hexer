# hexer

Yet another hex editor. Features direct view of all kinds of data interpretations, and in-line data type annotation system with markers which is reusable across files.

## Todo

Minor:
- improve search result marking / navigation
- marker view (edit/navigate)
- file summary / navigation pane (reduced view of entire file on the right like some text editors)

Major:
- binary diff tools
- automatic data type analysis / heuristic
